1) I used the python documentation and stack overflow for documentation related to enabling CLI based interfaces for python programs. 

These are the links I used for this: 

https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20063/whats-the-best-way-to-parse-command-line-arguments

2) I had this weird error while trying to import the requests module. I had to use the command import pip._vendor.requests as requests to solve the error. 

A kind stack overflow user helped me out with this:

3) I used a lot of trello.com references related to interaction with their api. 

These are all the references I used:

https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/api-group-actions/#api-group-actions

https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/api-group-cards/#api-cards-id-actions-comments-post

4) I used this website for help with syntax reagrding the requests and response for post methods.
